# arch_challenge

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is to demonstrate my understanding of flutter framework.

#this project uses bloc pattern for state management and it uses clean architecture for file/folder structure

To start:
run
- flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons //to generate the app Icons


to build an APK run 
- flutter build apk --dart-define-from-file=dev.config.json --release
to build an IPA run 
- flutter build ios --dart-define-from-file=dev.config.json --release:

##Things i couldn't complete

- The tests will require some more time to figure out
- Code comments (though I added comments for some logic but not as i want to because of time constraint)
- Pipeline deployments for dev, uat, qat: both azure and github deployment

##Side Note
- i added some extra classes to demonstrate my full capability as a flutter developer
